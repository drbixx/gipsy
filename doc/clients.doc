Description:  All GIPSY clients are listed in this file. GIPSY clients
              of the same machine architecture are supposed to run the
              same version of the operating system and compilers.
              Each client has a one line entry which contains several
              fields separated by colons ':'.

              Field        Meaning
                #1         Hostname of GIPSY client or the string 'Generic-'
                           followed by the result of 'uname -s'.
                #2         Architecture (i.e. alliant, aix, sun4).
                #3         Flag which denotes what the client may do:
                           bit 1 (  +1): client may run gipsy.
                           bit 2 (  +2): user may compile gipsy sources.
                           bit 3 (  +4): user may install gipsy sources.
                           bit 4 (  +8): compile runs not on GIPSY uid.
                           bit 5 ( +16): compile uses own locking mechanism.
                           bit 6 ( +32): old executables are NOT saved.
                           bit 7 ( +64): compile runs on a remote machine
                                         (bit must always be turned on,
                                         except at the GIPSY source server
                                         site).
                           bit 8 (+128): compile obtains sources from the
                                         GIPSY source server.
                           bit 9 (+256): compile uses symbolic links for
                                         synonyms (ln -s).
                #4         Name of the gip_exe directory.
                #5         Name of the gip_lib directory.
                #6         Name of the gip_tmp directory.

              Generic clients can only run GIPSY, not compile or install.

Examples:     scott:sol4:103:/gipsy/exe/sol4:/gipsy/lib/sol4:/gipsy/tmp/sol4
              Generic-Linux:linux:67:/gipsy/exe/linux:/gipsy/lib/linux:/gipsy/tmp/linux

Updates:      May 23, 1991: KGB Document created.
              Nov 15, 2004: JPT Generic feature documented.
