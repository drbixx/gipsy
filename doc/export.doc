Use:          export.csh [-b] [-s] [-t tapedevice] [archs]

              -b                export binaries.
              -s                export sources.
              -t tapedevice     export to tapedevice. Default export
                                to GIPSY export directory.
              archs             architectures to export. Default all
                                available architectures will be
                                exported

Description:  The sources are stored in $gip_root/export/src/gipsy-src.???
              in files of 0.5 Megabyte each. The binaries are stored in
              $gip_root/export/"arch"/gipsy-bin.???, also in files
              of 0.5 Megabyte each. The $gip_root/export directory should
              be a link to the gipsy directory of the anonymous ftp
              directory. The gipsy account must have write priviledge to
              the gipsy directory of the anonymous ftp account.
