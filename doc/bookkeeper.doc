Description:  This file list only the compilables. It maintains the
              status of the sources for all achitectures. The first
              uncommented line in this document contains the names
              of all the architectures, separated by colons.
              Each source has a one line entry with 5 fields, separated
              by colons (:). The different fields have the following
              meaning:

              Field #      Meaning
                 1         Name of source.
                 2         Type of source ("sub" or "tsk" ).
                 3         Update bit mask. If the bit is set for
                           a particular architecture, it is up to date.
                 4         Delete flag. Non-zero indicates that it is
                           queued for deletion.
                 5         Error bit mask. If the bit is set for
                           a particular architecture, it could not be
                           compiled.
