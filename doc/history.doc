Description:  The history file keeps a record of each installation of a
              source file. It is updated by $gip_exe/compile.
              Each modification of a source file has a one line entry
              in the history file, which consists of several fields,
              separated by colons (:).
              The fields have the following meaning:
              field    meaning
                1      name of source file.
                2      type of source file (i.e. doc, inc, sub or tsk).
                3      version number of source file starting from zero.
                4      date of installing a particular version.
                5      username of person who installed the version.
                6      current owner of source file. If owner is
                       not equal to GIPSY or WASTEBASKET, the file has
                       been reserved (by the owner). If owner is
                       WASTEBASKET, the file has been removed and is
                       currently stored in $gip_old.
                7      the size of the source file in bytes.

Notes:        With the command '$gip_exe/compile -history <source> the
              complete history of source file <source> will be shown.

Updates:      May 21, 1991: KGB Document created.
