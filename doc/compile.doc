Purpose:      Describes how to compile/install a procedure/application
              program, how to install a document or include file,
              how to (un)reserve a source file with the program
              compile.

Use:          $gip_exe/compile [switches] [source file(s)]

              The following switches are recognized by the program:

              -#          discard default switch #.
              -c          compile sources.
              -cc #       # indicates the name of the c compiler to
                          be used instead of the default.
              -check      checks the GIPSY tree for strange and missing
                          files.
              -copts      defines the following switches to be compiler
                          switches.
              -delete     deletes a source file.
              -export #   compares the history files in $gip_sys and
                          #/sys, and copies new/modified sources to #.
              -fc #       # indicates the name of the fortran compiler
                          to be used instead of the default.
              -if #       # is the name of a file which contains
                          names of source files (one per line).
              -import #   compares the history files in # and $gip_sys,
                          and copies new/modified sources to $gip_sys.
              -install    install new version(s) of source file(s).
              -lopts      defines the following switches to be loader
                          switches.
              -o #        # denotes the name of the executable to
                          be produced.
              -purify     uses purify to build/link tasks.
              -rebuild    rebuilds procedures and applications.
              -reserve    reserves a source for the user.
              -retrieve   retrieves an older version of a source file
                          (-version switch must also be used).
              -sub        same as -c.
              -sysgen     used only when generating the system.
              -unreserve  unreserves a source file reserved by the user.
              -update     updates out of date procedures (and
                          applications if -c or -sub not used).
              -version #  # indicates the version number of a source file
                          for retrieval or reinstall (only with
                          -retrieve switch).
              -X          (private use) adds X11 compiler and/or linker
                          options to the compiler command.
                          If switch is found in the first line of a c-source
                          file, it had the same effect for privileged use.
              -XT         (private use) adds X-Tookit compiler and/or linker
                          options to the compiler command.
                          If switch is found in the first line of a c-source
                          file, it has the same effect for privileged use.

              The files extracted while installing a (new) source will be
              directed to the following directories:

              Extension           Directory
              .dc0 .doc .tex      gip_doc
