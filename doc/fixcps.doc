Script:      fixcps

Purpose:     Convert PGPLOT colour PostScript files incompatible with
             Ghostscript version >=9.00.

File:        fixcps.py

Author:      J.P. Terlouw

Use:         $gip_sys/fixcps.py infile outfile

             infile   incorrectly rendered PostScript file
             outfile  corrected file; may be the same as infile which
                      then will be overwritten.

Description: This Python script converts existing PGPLOT PostScript files
             with colour images which are not rendered correctly by
             Ghostscript version >= 9.00. These versions handle color spaces
             differently from previous versions. A symptom is completely
             black images. Also certain PostScript printers may have similar
             problems.

             Files written with GIPSY's new PGPLOT PostScript driver
             (June 2012) shouldn't have these problems anymore.

Updates:     Jun  8, 2012: JPT, Document created.
