Description:  This document describes how GIPSY software is documented
              and how this documentation is structured.

              In GIPSY every piece of software is required to have one or
              more associated documents. There exist also documents which
              are not associated with a particular source file. Such
              documents typically describe aspects of GIPSY which have a
              more general character. This document is an example of these.

              Documentation types
              -------------------
              Six types of documentation exist:

              dc1 - user documentation of the tasks. These documents reside
                    in directory $gip_tsk.

              dc2 - documentation of general subroutines to be used by
                    programmers writing tasks or other subroutines.
                    Residence: $gip_sub.

              dc3 - documentation of low level, often system dependent,
                    subroutines. Ideally, application programmers do not
                    need to know about these routines. Residence: $gip_sub.

              doc - documents describing various parts of GIPSY and its
                    tools and utilities such as the compile utility,
                    different server programs, etc. Residence: $gip_doc.

              tex - documents in TeX or LaTeX format, such as user and
                    programmer guides. Residence: $gip_doc.

              hypertext - html documents, possibly accompanied by illustrations
                    in e.g. GIF format. Residence: $gip_htm and subdirectories.

              The required documents are always of one of the types dc1, dc2,
              dc3 and doc. TeX and hypertext documentation is optional.


              Document structure
              ------------------
              The document types dc1, dc2, dc3 and doc all have a similar
              structure. They are ASCII text files containing a number of
              sections of which some are required and others optional.
              All sections begin with a keyword in the leftmost position
              of a line, followed by a colon, followed by one or more blanks.

              'name':   (required)
                 This must be the first section of the document. It states the
                 name of the document which must be identical to the filename
                 of the document with the document type (.dc1 etc.) left off.
                 For the keyword 'name' an appropriate keyword such as
                 "Program", "Function", "Document", "Subroutine" etc. 
                 should be chosen.

              Purpose:  (required)
                 A short, preferably one-line, description of the purpose of
                 the documented software or of the document itself.

              Category: (required)
                 One or more categories, separated by commas, in which
                 the document fits. Every category must be one of the
                 categories documented in categories.doc.

              File:     (required)
                 The name of the source file in which the document is
                 incorporated.

              Author:   (required)
                 The name of the author of the document and/or software.
                 If someone else than the author is responsible, his/her
                 name can be added in parentheses after the author's name.

              Updates:  (required)
                 This should be the last section of the document. It specifies
                 the date when the document was created and any dates when
                 the document or the documented software was modified, the
                 initials of the person responsible for the modification,
                 and a short description of the modification.

              Keywords: (required for task documents)
                 This section documents all user input keywords. Every
                 keyword should start on a new line, followed by an
                 explanation. Keywords should be written in uppercase
                 characters and the trailing equals sign should be included.
                 Example: "INSET=". Hidden keywords should be preceded
                 by two asterisks and a blank. Example: "** GAIN=".

              Use:      (required for subroutines and functions)
                 A detailed specification of the calling sequence;
                 the return value and all arguments to the routine, their
                 types and whether they are input and/or output arguments.

              Description: (optional)
                 Everything necessary or useful to further explain what
                 the document is about.

              Example(s):  (optional)

              Related Docs:(optional)
                 A list of related document files.

              Notes:       (optional)

              The above list is not exhaustive. If necessary, the document
              writer may invent other section names.


              Document inclusion
              ------------------
              As said, every piece of software in GIPSY is required to
              have one or more associated documents.
              For tasks there is usually only one dc1 document per source
              file, but in the case of functions it is possible that one
              source file contains several functions. All these functions
              are required to have a separate dc2 or dc3 document.

              Documents must be included in such a way that they can be
              extracted by the xfile utility (see xfile.doc). How this
              can be done depends on the kind of source file, e.g. a
              program in C or in Fortran, or a generic source file.
              A document is usually in the form of comments for the
              language being used. E.g. when programming in C, the
              document section could look like this:

                 /*
                 #>       clean.dc1
                 Program:      CLEAN

                 Purpose:      This program cleans maps or lines.
                       .
                       .
                       .
                 Updates:      Apr 17, 1991: KGB Document created.
                               Dec 11, 1991: KGB Cancel replaced by reject.
                 #<
                 */

              For a Fortran program it could look like this:

                 *#>recover.dc1
                 *Program:      RECOVER
                 *
                 *Purpose:      Recover a corrupt GDS set
                       .
                       .
                       .
                 *Updates:      May  8, 1995: JPT, Document created.
                 *#<
                 


              Hypertext documentation
              -----------------------
              At the time of the writing of this document, GIPSY's 
              hypertext documentation was still in an experimental phase.
              Features decribed below are tentative.

              In a similar way as described for the ASCII documentation,
              hypertext documentation can be included
              as files with the extension '.html'. These files will then all be
              placed in a subdirectory of $gip_htm with the same name as
              the source file with the extension stripped off. For instance
              if the source file srvreq.c contains the documents
              index.html, init.html and finis.html, these three files will be
              placed in directory $gip_htm/srvreq/.

              More elaborate hypertext documents, not fitting in the simple
              scheme above, e.g. containing GIF images, PostScript files,
              etc., can be brought into the system as .info files which
              can be created with the utility "infopack".
