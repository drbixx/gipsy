Description:  This script obtains the necessary files to compile and run
              GIPSY. The script should be run in the GIPSY ROOT directory,
              i.e. the directory where all the GIPSY sub directories will
              be created. It tries to obtain all necessary files via
              gftp from the GIPSY server at the Kapteyn Astronomical
              Institute.
              You should obtain the executable of gftp from the anonymous
              ftp directory at kapteyn.astro.rug.nl and copy
              it (in binary mode) from gipsy/<machine-architecture>/gftp to
              the directory where you want to run this script.
              Then type: chmod +x gftp to make it executable.
              The procedure to install GIPSY via this script is as
              follows:

               1) Goto the directory where you want to have all the
                  GIPSY sub directories  (the so called GIPSY ROOT).
                  Also the gftp executable should be here.
               2) type: sysgen.csh
                  This command should get the necessary files from the
                  GIPSY source server. If the script complains that some
                  files could not be retrieved, run it again until it
                  does not complain anymore.
               3) type: setenv gip_root `pwd`
                  This defines the GIPSY ROOT directory
               4) type: cd sys
                  Goto the directory where all the GIPSY scripts are.
               5) type: mkclient.csh 199
                  This command makes the current host a GIPSY client,
                  i.e. it creates an entry in the clients file. The modified
                  files is in the current directory and is called clients.new.
                  You should check this file and if necessary, modify it.
                  Usually the fields which are modified are the paths to the
                  GIPSY exe, lib and tmp directory. A description of the
                  clients file and the mkclient.csh script can be found in
                  ../doc/clients.doc and ../doc/mkclient.doc resp.
               6) type: mv clients.new ../loc/clients
               7) type: source gipenv.csh
                  This command sets the GIPSY enviroment variables. A
                  description of the gipenv.csh script can be found in
                  ../doc/gipenv.doc.
               8) The next step is to create the setup file for the compilers
                  in the $gip_loc directory. You can check the
                  $gip_sys/setup.mgr file for entries which match your local
                  situation, and copy the relevant part to ${gip_loc}/setup.
                  You also might want to create a manager file. A desription
                  can be found in $gip_doc/manager.doc.
               9) type: install.csh
                  This script compiles the basic GIPSY programmes necessary
                  to create the GIPSY library and applications.
                  A description can be found in $gip_doc/install.doc.
              10) Read $gip_doc/server.doc and check whether your machine
                  can resolve the address of the GIPSY source server.
                  If not, you must create a file server in $gip_loc with
                  the correct address of the GIPSY source server.
              11) type: p -sysgen >& p.log &
                  This command will generate the GIPSY library and the
                  GIPSY applications. It will retrieve the sources from
                  the GIPSY source server and compile them.
              12) If compilation has been successfull, you should put
                  in your .cshrc the following lines:
                  setenv gip_root <path to GIPSY ROOT>
                  source ${gip_root}/sys/gipenv.csh
                  If you want to receive regular updates of GIPSY
                  applications, you should read $gip_loc/update.doc
                  In order to get a working system, you should read
                  in $gip_doc grdevices.doc, lpdevices.doc, mtdevices.doc
                  and tvdevices.doc.
