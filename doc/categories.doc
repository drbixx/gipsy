Document:     categories

Purpose:      Categories for tasks and subroutines

Category:     DOCUMENTATION

File:         categories.doc

Author:       M.G.R. Vogelaar

Description:  This document describes the different categories that can be
              used to identify different types of programs and subroutines. 
              These categories are to generate a list of programs 
              (or subroutines) sorted in functionality. 
              For this purpose EVERY document MUST have a line 
              containing a category name. The syntax for this is as follows
              (Names can be in any case)

              Category:    <category name>[, <category names>]

              'Category:' must be left aligned. The category name in a 
              document can be in any case and starts at the 15th column. 


              Organisation of this file:

              The categories mentioned in this file are sorted and
              have a comment that starts with a '/' character. 
              There are categories for tasks (the list starts with
              #tasks:), for subroutines (#subroutines:)
              and for general documentation (#general:). Each field 
              is separated by at least one empty line.
              The file must be updated with 'compile' (p).
