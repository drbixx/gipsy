Purpose:      Installs or reinstalls the GIPSY essentials. It also
              creates the directory tree.

Category:     MANAGEMENT

File:         install.csh

Author:       K.G. Begeman

Use:          install should be run by the GIPSY manager to (re)install
              the GIPSY basics on a certain type of machine. The GIPSY
              environment variables must have been defined (gipenv.csh) and
              the $gip_sys/setup.mgr file adapted for the host machine.

Description:  install installs the compile program, the Fortran to C
              interface program, the file extracter, the gipsy file
              transporter, the gipsy lock server, the Sheltran compiler
              and the PGPLOT fonts.
              It creates the system dependent directories for the
              GIPSY libraries, executables and temporary files (if
              they do not yet exist!).
              install also checks whether it can find the X11 libraries
              and include files.

Warning:      This script runs only on (some) UNIX systems.
