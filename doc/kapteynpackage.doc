Description: Running this program displays a message about the current
             version of the Kapteyn Package. The main purpose of installing
             this program is to install the Kapteyn Package within GIPSY.
             This is done as a side-effect of the installation.
             The installation procedure first fetches the package's
             distribution from the web using wget and then installs it
             under $gip_exe using the package's normal install script setup.py.

             If problems have ocurred with the package's installation, more
             information can be found in GIPSY's update log file. If this is
             not available, running the following command from the GIPSY
             account will show this information again:

                 p -rebuild kapteynpackage.src

             The download program wget or one or more prerequisites may be
             missing, such as Python, WCSLIB and NumPy. Of the latter,
             also their header (.h, "include") files need to be present.
             Those are usually provided by the respective development
             packages of your system's distribution. After correcting the
             problem, repeating the rebuild command will install the package.

             If you need to use the Kapteyn Package outside GIPSY, and if
             it is not installed in another way, you can point the environment
             variable PYTHONPATH to $gip_exe:

                 setenv PYTHONPATH $gip_exe

             after which it can be used normally.

             More information about the Kapteyn Package can be found on the
             webpage http://www.astro.rug.nl/software/kapteyn/.
