Use:          This shell script starts the Fortran to C compiler. The
              generated C code is compiled into objects or executables.
              It recognizes the following options:

              -f2c             indicates that the following options until the
                               next occurrence of this option are for the
                               Fortran to C compiler.
              -f2cC <arg>      <arg> is name of C compiler to use after
                               conversion from Fortran to C [cc].
              -f2cE <arg>      <arg> is the name of the Fortran to C compiler
                               which should be used [f2c].
              -f2cI <arg>      <arg> is the path to the directory where
                               include files needed for the compilation of
                               the C sources created by the Fortran to C
                               compiler reside.
              -f2cK            do not remove the generated C code.

              All other switches (except those in between two -f2c options)
              are passed to the C compiler.
