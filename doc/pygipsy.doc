Purpose:      Python module interfacing with GIPSY

Category:     SYSTEM

File:         pygipsy.src

Author:       J.P. Terlouw

Description:  pygipsy implements a pre-compiled module which can be
              used for writing GIPSY tasks in Python.  Prerequisites are a
              supported architecture (now Linux or MacOS), Python 2.3 or
              higher, and NumPy.  If these requirements are not met, the
              installation procedure will produce a non-functional dummy
              module. When the requirements are met afterwards, the module
              can be built with 'p -rebuild pygipsy.src'.
              Pygipsy is fully documented in GIPSY's web pages.

Use:          From an executable Python program: "import gipsy"
              or "from gipsy import ...".
