Use:          rmtserver can be used in two modes: the server mode
              and the local mode. In server mode rmtserver acts as
              a daemon and has to be started on the hosts which have
              tape devices attached. It has to be started only once
              with the following command line:

              rmtserver -daemon <directory>

              The directory is the directory where the file mtdevices
              resides (normaly $gip_loc). rmtserver will examine this
              file whether there are any tape devices associated with
              the current host (field #3), and if so it will run in
              daemon mode.
              rmtserver can best be started by crontab every hour. You
              can use the rmtserver.csh script (in $gip_sys) for this.
              rmtserver can also be started via the /etc/rc.local or
              /etc/localrc scripts. You have to ask the system mananger
              to add the following lines:

              # Start remote tape server
              if [ -f $gip_exe/rmtserver ]; then
                      $gip_exe/rmtserver -daemon $gip_loc
                      echo -n ' GIPSY Remote Tape Server'
              fi

              Note: the $gip_exe and the $gip_loc symbols will probably
              be undefined, so you will have to replace them with the
              real path names.

              The internet portnumber should be specified in field #7
              of the $gip_loc/mtdevices setup file, or the system
              manager must also edit the /etc/services file
              to add the port for the rmtserver in the following way:

              # GIPSY functions
              GIPSYRTS        3198/tcp        # GIPSY Remote Tape Service

              It does not matter which portnumber you specify (here 3198),
              as long as all hosts which run GIPSY and which have tape
              devices use the same portnumber.

              The other mode of operation of rmtserver is the local mode.
              In this mode rmtserver is started by the mtopen routine.
              It can only work properly if the user has access to
              the remote host. On the remote host the local host must be
              added to the .rhosts file in the users home directory. Also
              the .cshrc on the remote system must properly setup the
              GIPSY environment.
