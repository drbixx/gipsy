Programme:    lckserver

Purpose:      Handles GIPSY (un)lock requests on files.

Category:     SYSTEM

File:         lckserver.c

Author:       K.G. Begeman

Use:          $gip_exe/lckserver directory

Description:  The GIPSY functions gip_lock and gip_unlock start the
              lckserver if it was not running yet. When started,
              it will create a inet socket on which it will be listening
              for connection requests from the gip_(un)lock functions.
              It will write a hidden file .glock in the directory where the
              locking is monitored by the server in which the hostname
              and the inet port number are stored (separated by a colon).
              If no requests are pending, the server will die after one hour
              and remove the .glock file. So the lckserver monitors the locking
              in a particular directory (the one entered on the command line).
