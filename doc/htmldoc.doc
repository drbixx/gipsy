Use:          $gip_exe/htmldoc type
              
              type is the documentation type: "dc1", "dc2", "dc3" or "doc".

Description:  The program generates a number of html files in the current
              working directory, depending on 'type'.

              dc1:
                   alltasks.html with links to the .dc1 documents;
                   cattasks.html with links to catagorized .html documents;
                   <category>_tasks.html with links to .dc1 documents for
                   every category.
              dc2:
                   alldc2subs.html with links to the .dc2 documents;
                   catdc2subs.html with links to catagorized .html documents;
                   <category>_dc2subs.html with links to .dc2 documents for
                   every category.
              dc3:
                   alldc3subs.html with links to the .dc3 documents;
                   catdc3subs.html with links to catagorized .html documents;
                   <category>_dc3subs.html with links to .dc3 documents for
                   every category.
              doc:
                   alldocs.html with links to the .doc documents;
                   catdocs.html with links to catagorized .html documents;
                   <category>_docs.html with links to .doc documents for
                   every category.

              As input it takes the documents of the designated type for
              the purpose lines and source file names and it reads
              the document 'categories.doc' for the category descriptions.

              The program also detects whether there is an html file with the
              name $gip_htm/<name>/index.html, where <name> is the name
              of the document file, with the type stripped off.
              If such a file exists, htmldoc will extract the information
              in the html TITLE field and uses this to create a link to
              the file. E.g.: "See also: Supplementary documentation".

              The generated files will usually be placed in $gip_htm/dc123doc.
