File:         gipenv.csh

Author:       K.G. Begeman

Use:          when running csh, execute this C shell script in .cshrc by
              the following statement:

              source $gip_root/sys/gipenv.csh

              when running sh, execute gipenv.sh in .profile by the
              following statement:

              . $gip_root/sys/gipenv.sh

Notes:        1) gip_root must have been defined before this statement
              and is system dependent. For example for the Kapteyn alliant
              gip_root must be defined as follows in .cshrc:
              setenv gip_root /dj3/users/gipsy
              and in .profile:
              gip_root=/dj3/users/gipsy; export gip_root
              2) if a local setup file exists ($gip_root/loc/gipenv.csh
              or $gip_root/loc/gipenv.sh), then the local file will be
              executed.
