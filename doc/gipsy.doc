Use:          $gip_sys/gipsy.csh [session_number] ( when running csh )
              $gip_sys/gipsy.sh  [session_number] ( when running sh )

              session_number       Gipsy session id [1]. If you want to
                                   run two gipsy sessions separately on
                                   the same user account, you need to
                                   specify different session numbers.
                                   If you want to run more than one
                                   display server (gids), you also should
                                   specify different sessions numbers.
                                    
Notes:        The gipsy.csh script looks for $HOME/.gipsyrc, and the
              gipsy.sh script looks for $HOME/.gipsysc. If present,
              the script will executae it.
