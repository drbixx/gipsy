Use:          Part of this documentation is used in HELP to display
              general information about a subject. A field starts with
              #startn where n is the number of a field. The field is
              closed with #end

Description:  This document provides the text that HELP displays for
              certain subjects. The contents can be updated when

                       GENERAL HELP ABOUT HERMES
                       =========================

If you started tHermes, pressing <TAB> will display the documentation (i.e. the 
dc1 document) of the task name that is present in the user command area. If 
there is also a keyword present, then the display is positioned at the first
occurrence of the keyword in the document. When <TAB> is pressed for the second 
time, the help display will disappear. If the user command area is empty, you 
get a help screen with key definitions for Hermes (not available in xHermes).
You can browse through the documentation using the <pgup> and <pgdown> keys 
(or ^V and ^Z). There is a chapter about Hermes in the GIPSY User Guide. In 
tHermes you quit by pressing ^Q (or typing END or QUIT or CTRL-X CTRL-C or 
ESC Z). Then you are prompted with:    

Quit? Press: Y. 

If you press Y and there are still tasks running you get the message 
'Wait for tasks to finish...'. Tasks can be aborted with ^C

                      GENERAL HELP ABOUT APPLICATIONS
                      ===============================
                
All applications have a document that is displayed when pressing <TAB> in Hermes 
while there is a task name in the user command area. The application NEWS 
displays the GIPSY news which you have not yet seen. This news can contain 
important information about new releases, fixed bugs etc.
BUG is a program to report application bugs. 
All task documents can be send to printer (HELP SUBJECT=4).


INPUT EXAMPLES (see input.doc for more detailed description):
==============

1) Input of set and subsets:

   The structure AURORA is 3-d and has axes RA,DEC and FREQ 
   with sizes:

   RA            from   -63 to    64
   DEC           from   -63 to    64 
   FREQ          from     1 to    32

   INSET=AURORA FREQ 10:18 24  or
   INSET=AURORA F 10:18 24     or
   INSET=AURORA 10:18 24
   gives 2-d planes (RA,DEC) for values of FREQ 10 to 18 and 24

   INSET=AURORA F      or
   INSET=AURORA 1:32
   gives 2-d planes (RA,DEC) for values of FREQ 1 to 32

   INSET=AURORA DEC 5:10 FREQ 10 
   gives 1-d lines (RA) for values of DEC 5 to 10 at FREQ 10

   INSET=AURORA                   
   gives the whole 3-d cube

   INSET=AURORA DEC 1           
   gives 2-d plane (RA,FREQ) for a value of DEC 1

   INSET=AURORA RA 0 DEC 0 FREQ 1
   gives a pixel at (RA, DEC, FREQ) = (0, 0, 1)

        
2. Input of floating point or integer numbers         

   1 2 3/3  sin(pi)      yields       1.0 2.0 1.0 0.0
   log(10)::4            yields       1.0 1.0 1.0 1.0
   log(10):log(100):2/4  yields       1.0 1.5 2.0
   10**[0 1 5]           yields       1 10 100000
   10**[0:3]             yields       1 10 100 1000

   Suppose an inclination at keyword INCL= must be given in 
   degrees, but you want the input in axis ratio.

                  INCL=DEG(ACOS([0.3 0.5]))
                  
   Between square brackets (the list facility) are the 
   arguments 0.3 and 0.5. The expression evaluates twice
   the value for the ACOS en converts these values to 
   degrees. The result is that the values 0.3 and 0.5
   are converted to the angles 72.5424 and 60.0 deg.
                 

3. Input of positions:

   POS=* 10 12 8 * -67 8 9.6      
   RA = 10 hour, 12 min, 8 sec, DEC = -67 deg, 8 min, 9.6 sec.,
   in a 2-d area and in the epoch as found in the header of the set.

   POS=*2000.0 3 14 38.02 *2000.0 41 13 54.84        
   Input of RA  3 h 14 m 38.02 s, DEC 41 d 13 m 54.84 s in
   epoch 2000.0

   BOX=G 56.7 G 9.89 D 12 ARCSEC 10 ARCSEC
   An area centered on galactic coord. 56.7 longitude, 9.89 latitude 
   with a size of 12 by 10 seconds of arc.

                      HOW TO GET DOCUMENTATION
                      ========================
                
               
In this program (HELP) you can obtain documentation about:
                
-GIPSY tasks (.dc1)                       HELP SUBJECT=4 DOCTYPE=1
-GIPSY subroutines (.dc2/.dc3)            HELP SUBJECT=4 DOCTYPE=2 or 3
-GIPSY Miscellaneous (.doc)               HELP SUBJECT=4 DOCTYPE=4
                
If there is no copy of the GIPSY user guide around, you can create one by 
processing and printing the laTeX file manual.tex in the directory associated 
with the shell variable gip_doc . For instance on a HP machine try:
                
> cp $gip_doc/manual.tex .   | Copy manual to your current directory
> latex manual.tex           | Create .dvi file  
> latex manual.tex           | Rerun to get references right
> dvips manual               | Print it
