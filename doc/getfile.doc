File:         getfile.csh

Author:       K.G. Begeman

Use:          getfile.csh filename

Description:  You have to follow the following 3 steps to obtain
              a file from the GIPSY source server.
              1. Goto the directory in the GIPSY tree where the file
              resides (i.e. cd $gip_tsk for compile.c and cd
              $gip_exe for compile).
              2. Type $gip_sys/getfile.csh filename to retrieve
              filename in the current directory. If the file already
              exists, it will be renamed to filename.old
              3. Check whether the file arrived. The script cannot
              check this. If the file has extension csh or it is a 
              binary executable, it will be made executable.

Example:      To obtain $gip_exe/stat
              cd $gip_exe
              $gip_sys/getfile.csh stat
