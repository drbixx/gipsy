Description:

(0)           HELP

              GIDS is the Groningen Image Display Server. It will display
              two dimensional images which have to be loaded into GIDS by a
              special program (i.e. the GIPSY program VIEW).

              MOUSE BUTTONS:
              Here we assume that button1 is the left-most mouse button,
              button2 the middle mouse button and button3 the right-most
              mouse button.

              To remove the HELP window, press HELP again with button1 or
              button3 or press a mouse button in the help window.

              DISPLAY WINDOW:
              In the display window the images are shown. At startup the
              display window is the right-most window with a size of 512 x 512.
              It is possible to resize this window. The minimum size is
              128 x 128, the maximum size depends on the size of the screen.
              Each resizing of the display window will remove all previous
              recordings.

              WEDGE WINDOW:
              To the left of the display window the wedge window is placed.
              This window displays the current color lookup table.

              CALIBRATION WINDOW:
              To the left of the wedge window the calibration window is placed.
              Here the data values as a function of current color are
              displayed graphically.

              INFO WINDOWS:
              GIDS has 7 info windows which are placed in the upper-left
              window of GIDS (white on black). From top to bottom, the first
              two display info related to the image currently in the display
              window. This information depends on what the program which loaded
              the image into GIDS found necessary to show the user.
              The third window displays information about the recordings
              (REC= MR, NR, CR), where MR is the maximum number of recordings
              the server can handle, NR the number of images recorded and
              CR the current record number in the display window. Record 0 is
              special since here always the last image loaded into GIDS is
              stored. It is only possible to (de)zoom this image. Pressing
              the ETCETERA menu and then the RECORDING menu will show a
              list of recording options.
              The fourth window displays information about the graphics planes
              (MASK=  M ON=  N), where M is the current mask of graphics planes
              on which the graphics operation is valid and N the mask for the
              planes which are displayed. GIDS has 4 graphics planes, which are
              numbered 1, 2, 4 and 8. If more than one graphics plane is wanted,
              simply add the numbers. Pressing the ETCETERA menu and then the
              REGION menu will give a list of graphics plane operations.
              The fifth window displays the data value at the position of the
              cursor in the display window (VAL=   N).
              The sixth window will display the grids at the position of the
              cursor in the display window (POS=   X,   Y).
              The seventh window is an input window which displays the text
              entered via the keyboard. Some menu actions need the text in
              this window.

              MENU WINDOWS:
              Below the info windows menu windows are placed.
              Moving the pointer to a menu window will 'highlight' it, clicking
              mouse button1 or button3 will activate it. Clicking button2
              will give help on the menu item.

              CUSTOMIZATION OF GIDS:
              GIDS allows the user to specify some defaults in the .Xdefaults
              or .Xresources file. The parameters which can be set are the
              following:

(5)           CURSOR

              Pressing CURSOR will enable cursor mode and enter the curser
              menu. In cursor mode the user can send grid positions or the
              lower-left and upper-right grids of a box to an accepting
              program (usually hermes) or window.

              The cursor menu allows you to select the method of transfer
              of the cursor positions. You can choose between: the selection
              method, the sendevent method or the socket method. The socket
              method is default and is used with GIPSY (hermes).

              Mouse Button Control in display window.
              Pressing button1 in the display window will send the
              corresponding grid position to hermes.
              Pressing button2 and moving the cursor allows the user to draw
              a box on the display window. Pressing button2 again will allow
              the user to modify this box. Pressing button3 inside the box will
              send the box grids to hermes and remove the box, pressing
              button3 outside the box will only remove it.

(5.0)         CURSOR SELECTION

              The cursor positions are put as text in a selection, allowing
              other programs to request for the selection, i.e. simply go to
              the xterm with the cursor and press the middle mouse button to
              get the text into your program.

(5.1)         CURSOR SENDEVENT

              The cursor positions are sent as KeyPress events to a window
              which the user can select with the cursor. Note that the
              chosen  window must allow sendevents (for xterm, press
              <CTRL> together with the left mouse button).

(5.2)         CURSOR SOCKET

              Send the cursor positions as text to a socket. This is the
              default.

(5.3)         CURSOR APPEND-CR

              Append or don't append a CR (carriage return) to the string
              with positions to be sent. Default is don't append.

(5.4)         CURSOR RETURN

              Return to top menu and stay in CURSOR mode.

(6)           ETCETERA

              Pressing ETCETERA will activate the etcetera menu, where some
              extra options are made available, like manipulating recordings and
              graphics planes. Also the quit and resize button are programmed
              here.

(6.0)         ETCETERA QUIT

              Pressing QUIT will allow the user to quit via the quit menu.

(6.0.0)       ETCETERA QUIT NO

(6.0.1)       ETCETERA QUIT YES

              Gids is stopped graciously. Always exit via this menu item.

(6.1)         ETCETERA GRAPHICS

              Pressing GRAPHICS will open an extra window for plotting.
              Without the extra plot window plot output will appear in the
              display window.
              Pressing GRAPHICS again will remove the extra plot window
              and any plot output will again be redirected to the display
              window.

              The default plot window size is 512 x 512. The user can specify
              the size by typing the wanted X size and Y size (those numbers
              should appear in the lower info window) and then pressing
              GRAPHICS.

(6.2)         ETCETERA RECORDING

              Pressing RECORDING will activate the recording menu, where
              the user can manipulate the recorded images.

              The third info window displays information about the recordings
              (REC= MR, NR, CR), where MR is the maximum number of recordings
              the server can handle, NR the number of images recorded and
              CR the current record number in the display window. Record 0 is
              special since here always the last image loaded into GIDS is
              stored. It is only possible to (de)zoom this image.

(6.2.0)       ETCETERA RECORDING RECORD

              Typing the wanted record number and pressing RECORD will
              record the image currently in the display window.

(6.2.1)       ETCETERA RECORDING VIEW

              Pressing VIEW will enter view mode which will allow the user to
              manually loop through the recorded images.

              Mouse Button Control in display window:
              Pressing button1 in the display window will show the previous
              recording, pressing button3 will display the next recording.

              When pressing VIEW, the default action is to show the current
              record number. Any other recording can be viewed by typing its
              record number and then pressing VIEW.

(6.2.2)       ETCETERA RECORDING BLINK

              This option will allow the user to blink two images.

              Typing one or two record numbers and pressing BLINK will
              enter blink mode. If only one record number was typed, record 0
              will be used for the first recording and the record number
              entered for the second.

              Mouse Button Control in display window:
              Pressing any button will set the time interval between blinks.
              Blink frequency increases to the left.

(6.2.3)       ETCETERA RECORDING LOOP

              This option will allow the user to make a movie of
              the recorded images.

              Typing the wanted record numbers and pressing LOOP will
              enter loop mode.

              Mouse Button Control in display window:
              Button1: Loop backward.
              Button2: set the loop speed. Speed increases to the left.
              Button3: Loop forward.

              NOTE: Some programs already define the loop for the user
              (i.e. the GIPSY program VIEW with RECORD=Y). The user
              then only needs to press LOOP and does not have to specify
              the record numbers.

(6.2.4)       ETCETERA RECORDING SPLIT

              This option will allow the user to view two images in split
              screen.

              Typing one or two record numbers and pressing SPLIT will
              enter split screen mode. In split screen mode gids displays
              in different parts of the display window the two recordings
              entered by the user. If only one record number was typed,
              record zero will be used for the first recording and the
              record number entered for the second.

              Mouse Button Control in display window:

(6.3)         ETCETERA REGION

              Pressing REGION will display record number zero and activate
              the region menu.

              This option is only of use in combination with a special
              program which can do something useful with the graphics data
              (i.e. GIPSY program BLOT for masking data).

              The fourth info window displays information about the graphics
              planes (MASK=   M ON=  N), where M is the current mask of
              graphics planes on which the selected operation (i.e. DEFINE)
              is valid and N the mask for the planes which are displayed.
              GIDS has four graphics planes which are numbered 1, 2, 4 and 8.
              If the user wants more than one graphics plane simply add the
              numbers.

              Graphics operations only work on the last image read into GIDS.

              graphics planes which will be modified are shown in the fourth
              info window (MASK=).

              Mouse Button Control in display window:
              Pressing Button1 for the first time will start the region
              (a polygon) to be removed on that position. The following clicks
              on Button1 will draw the outer boundaries of the polygon to be
              removed.
              Pressing Button2 will remove the last drawn boundaries.
