#begin section ggiinset_box
Purpose:
--------
        This element allows you to "compose" a set/subset specification
        and a "box". A box is a coordinate range of any dimensionality.

Procedure:
----------
        First choose a set name. You can type a set name in the top input
        field or you can have the file browser do that for you. The file
        browser can be activated by pressing the "BROWSE" button. 

        When a set has been selected, the panel below is filled with as many
        lines as there are axes in the set. 

        Each line consists of a text with the axis name, two buttons labelled
        "SUB" and "BOX", an input field and a text showing the
        range of the axis. The two buttons are mutually exclusive.

        If "SUB" is selected, you can use the input field to enter a list of
        subsets along the axis. This information is then incorporated in
        the set/subset specification

        If "BOX" is selected, you can use the input field to enter a range in
        coordinates along the axis. This range is then applied to the contents
        of the "BOX" input field below.

        When you are satistfied with your set/subset and box specification,
        press the "OK" button to send them to the application.
        
Alternative:
------------
        Experienced users can either bypass the above procedure or modify its
        results by typing directly in the "Set/subset" and "BOX" input fields.
        These changes are not reflected in the fields above.

#begin section ggiheaderbutton

   Set Header
   ==========

   This element allows you to inspect header information of the currently
   selected set. This information is generated by the task HEADER.

   You can control the output mode by typing in the "MODE" input
   field. For the possibilities select the "Output mode" entry.
