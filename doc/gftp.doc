Use:          gftp contacts the GIPSY source server and obtains GIPSY
              sources for remote updates. The programme is usually
              started from compile.
              The file $gip_loc/server is read to get the name of
              the GIPSY source server. If $gip_loc/server is not
              present, $gip_sys/server.mgr is tried.
              
              When compiled with -DSRC_SERVER, the resulting executable
              will be the GIPSY source server.

                                 if it fails with "normal" hostname.
