GIPSY

Description

GIPSY is an acronym of Groningen Image Processing SYstem. It is a
highly interactive software system for the reduction and
display of astronomical data. It was designed originally for the
reduction of interferometric data from the Westerbork Synthesis Radio
Telescope, but over the last 20 years it has grown to a system capable
of handling data from many different instruments. The UNIX version of 
GIPSY can be installed on many different architectures.


Starting GIPSY
                
At the Kapteyn institute, GIPSY is supported runs on:

                Alliant FX80           
                DECstations            
                HP 300 series          
                HP 700 series          
                Sun 4 systems          
                Convex C2 and C3
                IBM RS/6000

From a "standard" environment, you start a GIPSY session by typing: gipsy
This will start Hermes, the user interface of GIPSY. 


Hermes

Hermes is the user interface of GIPSY. It enables users to do multi-tasking 
in an organized fashion. Users have direct control over the application 
programs (tasks) they run: a running task can be suspended or aborted with a 
simple command; various settings can be changed while a task is running.
Parameters for a task can be specified at any time; if a task needs information
that has not been specified yet, the user is prompted.
Context-sensitive help about tasks is provided at a single keystroke.
Tasks keep the user informed in two ways: they write in a log file
in which the user can page and search and they can provide a one-line status
message, which can be frequently updated.

Hermes cannot be started directly by the user, but is started by a shell 
script (gipsy.csh) which prepares a number of settings before starting Hermes.

Examples of control keys used by Hermes:
<TAB> or <ctrl> I  : pop help screen up or down
<ctrl> C           : abort task
<ctrl> P           : enter or leave Common Output Area (COA) page mode
<ctrl> V           : page forward in, help display or keyword display
<ctrl> Z           : page back in, help display or keyword display


Exit from Hermes

You quit hermes by typing: END, QUIT, <ctrl> Q, or <esc> Z
Before the session can be closed you get the prompt: Quit? Press: Y

If you press Y and there are still tasks running, you get the message 
'Wait for tasks to finish...'. Tasks can be aborted with ^C


Help

Pressing <TAB> in Hermes, will display information about Hermes when
no task is involved (no task name on the command line). If you type the 
name of a task, pressing <TAB> will display information about that task. 
The task HELP can display or print a list of available tasks together with
their purpose lines. It provides also an introduction to the input syntax for
keywords. There are a couple of LaTex files (manual.tex, hermes.tex) in 
the directory $gip_doc, which need to be processed before they can be printed. 


GIDS

GIDS ( Groningen Image Display Server ) is the server you need to
display your 2-dimensional (sub)sets. It can be started with the task
INIDISPLAY or with VIEW (which needs a (sub)set). The use of GIDS is 
very simple. With your mouse (and one of its buttons) you select actions 
(zooming, scaling etc.) in the window with the menu bars.
Move the mouse pointer in one of the menu boxes and click one of the
mouse buttons. An action is initiated or a sub menu appears.


Hardware

Applications which need access to a printer or a tape device, can generate
a list of available devices on request. This list can be different on 
different machines.
