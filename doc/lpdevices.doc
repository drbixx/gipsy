Description:  The printer description consistsof several fields,
              separated by colons (:). The fields contain the
              following information:
              field          information
                1            Name of host or list of hosts (separated
                             by comma's) or and asterix (*) if printer
                             is for all possible hosts.
                2            Name of print device. The first device
                             available on the host will be the
                             default printer.
                3            Text string containing info about
                             printer
                4            C format string so as to form a legal
                             command which will print the file (like
                             lpr -Ptext %s). If the command starts with
                             a dollar sign ($), the print command is
                             executed by HERMES. Then the C format string
                             should look like:
                             $ @gip_exe:spooler "print %s" %d %s
                             (see spooler.doc)
                5            Number of columns on print device.
                6            Number of rows on print device.
